     * There are 43 functional interface in the java.util.function package
     * Some of these functional interfaces include;
     *
     * 1. Consumer: The consumer is an object that takes in a value(which might be an object) and returns nothing.
     * i.e ForEach(List) the for each takes in a consumer when dealing with list.
     *
     * 2. BiConsumer : The BiConsumer is an object that takes in 2 values(which might be objects) and returns nothing.
     * i.e ForEach(Map)  the for each takes in a biConsumer when dealing with map.
     *
     * 3. Supplier: The supplier is an object that takes in nothing and returns a value of the type stated.
     * i.e The generate method in the Stream API takes in a supplier.
     *
     * 4. Predicate: The predicate is an object that takes in a value and returns a boolean.
     *
     * 5. BiPredicate: The BiPredicate is an object that takes in 2 values(which might be objects) and returns a boolean.
     *
     * 6. FunctionSample: The function is an object that takes in something and returns something.
     * The first argument is the parameter type and the second argument is the return type i.e <parameter type, return type>
     *
     * 7. BiFunction: The biFunction is an object that takes in two values and returns something.
     *    The first two arguments is the parameter type and the third argument is the return type <parameter type, parameter type, return type>
     * 8. UnaryOperator
     * 9. BinaryOperator
     *
     * intStream,longStream and doubleStream are primitive types of the stream api
