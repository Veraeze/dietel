    /**
     * The classes and interfaces in the java.util.stream package makes up the StreamAPI
     * A working stream should have a source and a terminal operator/ operation.
     * It could have intermediate operators which could be zero or more.
     * All the operators/ operations are defined in the stream API as methods.
     * The terminal operator/ operation is mandatory.
     * The stream created from the generate method is infinite.
     * streams created from collections, arrays, directly are finite.
     *
     * Some intermediate operations/ methods include;
     * 1. filter()
     * 2. map()
     * 3. flatMap()
     * 4. sorted()
     * 5. distinct()
     *
     * Some Terminal operations/ methods include;
     * 1. reduce()
     * 2. forEach()
     * 3. sum()
